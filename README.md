### Notes
Since I am doing this project while also learning about VueJS, a lot of time is spent understanding how Vue works and the syntax. I regret to say that at the end I didnt manage to have the time to fancify or make the look better. However Im proud to actually say that functionally, it works as expected, mostly.

As far as the the project architecture and design decision, I mostly follow the standard VueJS practice like how the files and folder located, and the UI is broken down into many components for easy of reusablity
I decided to go with Vuex to store state since its an established library to handle global state management comparable to Redux. This make it easier to share and manage state across different components
